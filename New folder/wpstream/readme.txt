WpStream is a Video Streaming Plugin that lets you broadcast live events and helps you sell tickets or recordings via WooCommerce.

== Description ==
WpStream is designed for effortless Live Streaming, Video On Demand and Pay Per View. To use the plugin you will need an active account with <a target="_blank" href="https://wpstream.net">WpStream.net</a>.

To ensure affordable streaming best suited for your audience, you will be able to choose from one of the available commercial streaming packages. Each package comes with a predefined monthly streaming traffic and recording storage. A free trial is available. 

You may stream live directly from the browser or use specialized RTMP broadcast software like <a href="https://obsproject.com">OBS</a>, Air Solo, GoCoder, LiveU etc. Complete instructions and video tutorials are available on our website. 

Video playback is compatible with all modern browsers and platforms, including mobile. Each event you create will have its own pre-made video page and you may also include the player in any webpage of your WordPress site via shortcodes.

You can monetize your content by setting up the WooCommerce plugin and turning your live or recorded videos into products that can be sold on a one-time or recurring basis.
